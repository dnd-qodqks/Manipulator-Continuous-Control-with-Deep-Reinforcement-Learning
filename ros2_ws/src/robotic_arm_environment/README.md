Robotic Arm Simulation in ROS2 and Gazebo
  <br>
</h1>


## General Overview

This repository includes: First, how to simulate a 6DoF Robotic Arm **from scratch** using **GAZEBO** and **ROS2**. Second, it provides a custom **Reinforcement Learning Environment** where you can test the Robotic Arm with your RL algorithms. Finally, we test the simulation and environment with a reacher target task, using RL and the 6DoF Robotic Arm with a visual target point.

## Prerequisites

|Library         | Version (TESTED) |
|----------------------|----|
| Ubuntu | 20.04|
| ROS2| Foxy [link](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)|
| ros2_control |[link](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control/tree/foxy) |

## How to run this Repository 

In the following links you can find a step-by-step instruction section to run this repository and simulate the robotic arm:

* **Simulation in Gazebo and ROS2** --> [Tutorial-link](https://davidvalenciaredro.wixsite.com/my-site/services-7)
  - Configurate and spawn the robotic arm in Gazebo. 
  - Move the robot with a simple position controller.
   
* **Custom RL Environment** --> [Tutorial-link](https://davidvalenciaredro.wixsite.com/my-site/services-7-1)
  - A complete Reinforcement Learning environment simulation. 

* **Reacher task with RL** --> Cooming soon
  - Robot reacher task.
